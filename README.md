# cmpunlocker

Unlock tool for the NVIDIA CMP 170HX (GA100) mining card. Restores full SM compute throughput and unlocked HBM2e memory geometry that are restricted in firmware/OTP configuration.

## Proof of Concept

Below are memory and performance results after applying the unlock:

## Requirements

- Linux (x86-64)
- Root access
- NVIDIA CMP 170HX
- **nvidia-open 610.43.0x already installed** (libs + firmware)
- Kernel headers matching the running kernel (`linux-headers-$(uname -r)` / `kernel-devel`)
- Secure Boot disabled (patched modules are unsigned)
- Network access on first install (downloads matching stock `open-gpu-kernel-modules` sources)
- Python 3 (used at build time to select the compiled memory geometry)

## Install

To install cmpunlocker, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

To force a certain memory profile, use the `--profile` option:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --profile=8gb    # 8GB card → 64GB unlock
sudo ./install.sh --profile=10gb   # 10GB card → 40GB unlock
```

The stable default for a `10de:2082` 10GB card remains 40GB. An explicit
experimental profile is also available:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --profile=10gb80 # 10GB card → experimental 80GB geometry
```

This compiles the coherent 80GB values into the real driver path:
`CFG1=0x02779000`, `LMR=0x0000028B`, and
`fb_length=0x0000001400000000`. It is never selected automatically. On a mixed
20c2+2082 system, 20c2 cards stay on 64GB while 2082 cards use the experimental
80GB target. Capacity recognition alone does not establish workload stability;
see [Experimental 80GB](docs/EXPERIMENTAL_80GB.md).

Then perform a cold reboot (full power off, then boot).

## What Gets Unlocked

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Full SM compute throughput (SS0/SS1) | Working ✓ |
| Memory geometry (64GB on 8GB cards, 40GB on 10GB cards) | Working ✓ |
| Experimental 80GB geometry on 10GB cards | Opt-in; stability not established |
| PCIe Gen 2 speeds | Working ✓ |
| JTAG (Host2Jtag register access) | Working ✓ |
| Persistence across reboot (patched modules) | Working ✓ |

## Uninstall

To uninstall cmpunlocker, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./remove.sh --yes
```

Then perform a cold reboot (full power off, then boot).
